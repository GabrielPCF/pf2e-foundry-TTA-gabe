# pf2e-foundry-TTA-gabe
A Token Tooltip Alt setup for PF2e on Foundry VTT

##Instructions for Use
Click Tooltip Manager on the module settings for TTA, then click the Import button and copy paste the contents of the json file in this repo into there. Then check the two custom checkboxes next to Character and NPC. I recommend setting Max Rows to 3 as well, to make the end result look a bit neater

GMs see the following for all Player Characters and NPCs, players see the following for all Player Characters:
